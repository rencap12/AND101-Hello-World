## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!
- **Git Fundamentals**: I grasped the basics of Git, like cloning repositories, making changes, and pushing them to my own repo. It's a key skill for collaborating on projects.

- **Android Studio Skills**: I got hands-on with Android Studio, importing code from GitHub, running the app, and tweaking its components. It's crucial for developing Android apps.

- **Effective Documentation**: I practiced documenting my work with a video/GIF, showcasing app features clearly. It's essential for sharing progress and understanding in a project.
